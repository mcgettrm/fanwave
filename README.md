# CryptoTracker // Fanwave


## TODO:
- Probably don't actually need a copy of the backend vendor folder on host machine.... modify `docker-compose.yml` volumes
- Implement caching

## Interesting
- No Artisan on host machine due to PHP not being installed
- Develop the API endpoints using postman? Depends if the responses are routed in Laravel based on `accepts` header (probably yes?)
